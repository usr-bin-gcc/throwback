# throwback

!throwback is a simple test application for RiscOS that demonstrates how a source code editor can receive throwback messages from the compiler (and other programming tools, via the DDEUtils module.  Back in January I started writing a lightweight IDE for RiscOS, and I wrote this as a test program while working out how the API operates.  While I've been using RiscOS since 1988, I'd never done any Desktop programming, so I expect the code is non-optimal and unidiomatic, so all constructive criticism welcome.
